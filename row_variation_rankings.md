## Claims

Bent-over barbell row is the worst among all.

T-Bar row (non-chest supported) is better than bent-over row.

Unilateral barbell row with one end anchored is better than the first two.

Unilateral barbell row with one end anchored, while placing the other hand and knee on a bench, is the best among all due to its superior resistance profile.

## Detailed Claim Analysis

### **Claim 1:** Bent-over barbell row is the worst among all.

**Timestamp:** [00:00.000 -> 00:01.360]

**Exact Quote:** सबसे खराब

**Creator’s Sources:** None Provided

**Fact-Check Result:** Personal Opinion/Misleading

**Explanation:**  The influencer said that BB bend over is the worst exercise, but the main thing is on what basis he made this claim. The barbell row exercise is one of a number of rowing exercises used to enhance strength and muscle development in the upper back, posterior shoulder girdle, and shoulder joint muscles, respectively. It often is taught relatively early in a strength and conditioning program because of its relative simplicity. Its utility as a safe and effective strength development tool is predicated on sound instruction, effective supervision, and proper execution. We should also keep in mind that BB bend over also helps in developing our stability as well as core strength (training the transverse abdominis isometrically). So in this case, personal bias comes from the influencer's end.
